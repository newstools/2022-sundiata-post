The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) says there may be no extension of the registration deadline for the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME). Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, the registrar of the board, dropped the hint while monitoring the registration exercise in some centres on Friday, in Lagos. According to him, feelers reaching the board from states across the country reveal that the exercise has been seamless, hence there may be no room for an extension. “We are not expecting any extension. I want to say that we are very happy with the way the exercise has been going, two weeks after it started. “Our target is to make sure that about 100,000 can0 registers in a day. So far, I must say I am very satisfied with the registration exercise nationwide. “It gladdens my heart because it shows that we are on course, despite the few glitches witnessed in the registration exercise in some centres, there has been a huge progress made,” he stated.
