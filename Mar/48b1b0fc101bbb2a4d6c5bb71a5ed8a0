We can use it in the area of serving Demand Notices and even monitoring compliance,” he said.Yakubu thanked BICT for finding the agency and himself worthy of the awards.Presenting the awards, Director – General of BICT, Shehu Ibrahim, said it was in recognition of the organisation’s commitment, innovation and dedication to the use of ICT in their operations.He noted that through the use of ICT, the organisation had earned the confidence of tax payers and boosted the internally generated revenue of the state from about N 6 billion in 2018 to N16.8 billion in 2021.Ibrahim added that the agency was also able to expand the tax payers’ data bank from 22,161 to 345,729 within the period.He said the multiple revenue collection system, the central billing system, effective use of their website and timely use of email for most correspondences were some of the reasons for awarding NSIRS Excellence in Technological Innovation.Ibrahim said that the award were well deserved and expressed hope that other Ministries Departments and Agencies would be encouraged to emulate and adopt ICT usage in their operations.“We are also here to celebrate the NSIRS Chairman, Ahmed Yakubu Muhammad, for using his wealth of experience to advocate for the use of technology in revenue collection, making Nasarawa state one of the top digital revenue States in the country,” Ibrahim said.
