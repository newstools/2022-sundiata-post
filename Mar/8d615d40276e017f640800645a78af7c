The PUNCH reports that the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has decried the low turnout of candidates in the ongoing registration for the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination.  JAMB registrar, Prof Is-haq Oloyede, while inspecting the conduct of the registration process on Saturday in Kano State, said several Computer-Based Testcentres in the state witnessed low turnouts of candidates.“We are worried because, towards the end of the exercise, you will see people clamouring for an extension when they have the opportunity to register on time,” he said.Oloyede also noted that the board could register 100,000 candidates per day nationwide.“I went round CBT centres here in Kano, and there was a centre where there is only one candidate in the centre, that centre can register 20 candidates simultaneously.“And here, you can see where we have about 20 registration points; you see a few numbers of candidates.“We are not going to extend the period of the registration beyond March 26,” he added.While appealing to the media to assist sensitising candidates in registering, Oloyede reiterated that “it will not be possible for us to extend. And so far, we have registered about 1.41 million candidates”.  source 2017 JAMB: Applicants Decry Tasking Registration Formalities, Want More Centres In "News" By Fortune Abang Bwari (FCT)  -    The Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB), has so far registered 600, 000 candidates for the 2017 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) across the country.
