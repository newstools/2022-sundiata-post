 The Managing Director of News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), Mr Buki Ponle, says there is need to have more women in government and political offices to enhance the country’s development.He said this on Friday in Abuja when Mr Jake Epelle, the Founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Albinism Foundation Africa, paid him a visit.The NAN MD, who wondered why the role of women was not recognised, especially with the rejection of the pro-equality bills by the National Assembly, noted that “I am not a politician, but I will fight for women and children wherever I am. “I have a wife, I have daughters and relations who are women. I also have women who have made it in life. “Wherever we find ourselves on the gender scale, we must prove our mettle, and I commend Nigerian women for doing so well in many areas of endeavour, not only in politics, but in businesses.“I give kudos to women and I will always respect them; now we can trust our women with money, many of them are managing directors and Chief Executive Offices.”Ponle, who said he was overwhelmed by Epelle’s visit, added that the agency would continue to do its best to support the Abinism Foundation.He recalled that he had been watching Epelle for almost 20 years on television as he advocate for better conditions for people living with albinism, saying that even though he started modestly, he had been consistent.He said “your passion, committment and motivational speech are encouraging and worth emulating.“I am so touched by your passion because you have made what used to be object to become subject, talking about abinism: not only in Nigeria, but all over the world.“Abinos had no place untill you came out and fought for them to be placed on the front burner of development; that is a great feat and we commend your efforts in that regard.“We would want to be part of that development because it is not easy,” Ponle stressed.Earlier, Epelle said he was at the agency to thank the management for its support over the years and to seek for more collaboration in the area of giving visibility to issues affecting persons with disability in the country.He commended the agency’s reporters and correspondents, saying they stood out among their peers at events.He also commended the agency for standing out in providing accurate news reports to the public, adding that NAN had become a credible hub where even foreign media organisations picked news materials on Nigeria, Africa and other parts of the world.He said “there may be scarcity of fund, but I want to encourage you to please keep doing the work you are doing to the best of your ability.”He commended President Muhammadu Buhari for signing the Descrimination Against Persons with Disability Act, saying that the community would always remember him for that.He added that by signing the bill into law, Buhari had written his name in gold and demonstrated that he is a true democrat.He also commended the president for signing the Electoral Amendment Act Bill into law, saying “he has further demonstrated that he is a father to all, especially the marginalised.”Epelle then appealed to the NAN managing director to create a special desk dedicated to persons with disablity to increase reportage of issues affecting them.He added that “women deserve to be given a chance and persons with disability deserve to be given greater chance because we have been far left behind.” (NAN) ABUJA - Mrs Amina Salihu, the Co-Director, Board of Directors, Nigeria Women’s Trust Fund, has urged Nigerian women to vote for many credible women in 2015 general elections.
