The National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) has ordered the immediate suspension of Musiliu Akinsanya, popularly called MC Oluomo, the Lagos chapter’s chairman over alleged misconduct and insubordination to the union management.  Recall that Oluomo recently led a protest in which he, alongside some of his supporters, accused the union at the national level of unnecessarily interfering in state affairs.In a letter sent from the NURTW, Oluomo’s suspension was based on the premise that he incited members of the state chapter against the apex body, an act said to be against the NURTW constitution.The body has also directed MC Oluomo to immediately hand over the mantle of leadership to his deputy chairman and release all property belonging to the transport body in his possession to State Secretary, to avoid any leadership vacuum in the state.It explained that the decision to place MC Oluomo on indefinite suspension was basically to prevent any breakdown of law and order after it came to its notice that he was already inciting members against the union.In the letter dated March 9th, 2022, the national body said it resolved to suspend MC Oluomo after it became obvious that MC Oluomo was not apologetic over his actions even after he was directed to explain reasons for embarking on such.According to the letter signed by the General Secretary for the national body, Kabiru Yau, the Union promised to often ensure that the NURTW constitution remains sacrosanct and adhered to by members across the country.The letter reads: “This is to convey to you that in line with Article 42 section 5, subsection I, II, III, IV, V, and VIII of the union’s constitution, you have been placed on indefinite suspension from office as State Chairman of Lagos State Council of National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) with effect from March 9th, 2021.“Your suspension is sequel to sustained acts of insubordination and gross misconduct coupled with your clandestine plans to instigate crisis and unleash mayhem on any branch or branches of the union in Lagos state that refuses to obey your order or instructions not to accept directives from the national headquarters of the Union.“Your orchestrated plan to attack branches that may disobey your orders aforesaid will ultimately endanger public peace and order in Lagos state. It is also very likely to threaten and/or affect the lives and property of the peace-loving people of Lagos state, particularly those doing their legitimate businesses within motor parks, hence the urgent need to take drastic actions against him.“It is on record that you were earlier issued with queries on 25th of February 2022 and 3rd of March, 2022 respectively in which you were directed to explain the circumstances surrounding your untoward actions and to also show cause why disciplinary actions should not be taken against you for such acts of insubordination. You bluntly neglected/refuse to respond to the second query, while your response to the first query was unsatisfactory. “In view of your suspension, you are hereby directed to hand over the mantle of leadership of the Lagos State Council to the State Deputy Chairman and also surrender all Union properties in your possession to the State Secretary of the Union forthwith.”  SouRce Chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, NURTW, Musiliu Ayinde Akinsanya aka MC Oluomo, has debunked claims that he sent thugs to disrupt the ongoing EndSARS protest against police brutality in Alausa.   In a video making round on social media, MC Oluomo said he wasn’t the one… In "Politics" By Tajudeen Adebanjo The National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), Lagos State Council is planning to introduce emergency lines for the public to report errant drivers.
