The massive crowd gathered here today, speaks to the importance of this occasion.“This is an age-old tradition that we must continue to uphold. Yes, since the first coronation ceremony was held in the 1850s, we have maintained in the best way possible, given various circumstances, one of the best succession lines in Yoruba history.“So, we rejoice that today, we crown a new Olubadan. Our gathering here today is a victory for the sons and daughters of Ibadanland, and restoration of our traditional systems.“I have always taken a stand for the integrity of our traditional systems, and so I am especially delighted that today, Friday, March 11, 2022, the sanctity of this century-old dynasty has been restored.”The governor maintained that the new monarch has distinguished himself as an excellent professional and has contributed and will continue to contribute to the development of Ibadanland and Oyo State at large, having served both in private and public service.He added that he was assured that Oba Balogun is in a good position to defend the sanctity and tradition of Ibadan people and  move Ibadanland forward.The governor wished His Imperial Majesty, a long, peaceful and successful reign, praying that the land of Ibadan will experience unequalled development, and tranquility during Kabiyesi’s reign.Similarly, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, who spoke on behalf of President Muhammadu Buhari, congratulated the new monarch and the people of Ibadanland.In her welcome address, the Secretary to the Oyo State Government, Mrs. Olubamiwo Adeosun, said that the people of Ibadan are happy at the start of the new era signified by the installation of the 42nd Olubadan.Some of the highlights of the event include traditional homage-paying to the new Olubadan, led by the Otun Olubadan, High Chief Rashidi Ladoja, followed by other members of the Olubadan-in-Council, Council of Iyalodes, Mogajis and religious leaders, among others.The event had in attendance, among others, Vice-President Osinbajo; former Vice-President Abubakar; governors of Ekiti, Ogun and Kano, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, Prince Dapo Abiodun, Dr. Abdullahi Ganduje; representatives of the governors of Osun, Ondo and Edo states; former Governors Olagunsoye Oyinlola and Olusegun Mimiko.Among the traditional rulers in attendance were: Ooni of Ife, His Imperial Majesty, Oba Enitan Ogunwusi; Alaafin of Oyo, His Imperial Majesty, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III; Sultan of  Sokoto, His Eminence, Alhaji Abubakar Sa’ad; Emir of Kano, His Eminence, Alhaji Ado Bayero; Etsu Nupe, Dr. Yahaya Abubakar.National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Senator Iyorchia Ayu; a representative of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu as well as members of the National Assembly were also in attendance at the event.
