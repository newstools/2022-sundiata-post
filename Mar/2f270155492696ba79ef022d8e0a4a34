The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria chapter has called for the withdrawal of the degree certificates of Governor Nasir El-Rufai.  The union made the decision at its congress meeting held on March 2.El-Rufai graduated with a first-class degree in quantity surveying from ABU in 1976.Secretary of ABU ASUU Hussein Abdullahi said the union’s decision stems from the seizure of the university’s land at Mando, Kaduna by the state government.Abdullahi described the seizure as an “utter disregard of an order by a competent court of law,” suggesting that a court had ruled on the matter.“We have issued an advisory to relevant organs of Ahmadu Bello University to formally withdraw the degree certificates awarded to Nasir El-Rufai by the University as his many actions are in contravention of the requirements in character and learning deemed worthy of ABU degree award,” he added.El-Rufai had yet to react to the development as of press time.
