We don’t need conflict, we need peace in this country because Nigeria is a very important country.“I am living in Nigeria for the past nine years, so it is my country and I am proud as a Nigerian and I want to see the country’s development in unity and togetherness,” he said.Also, a leader of Abuja IDPs, Malam Abubakar Mustapha, commended Ufuk Dialogue and the agency for celebrating Eid-el-Kabir in a bigger way for the community.According to him, such gesture is coming for the first time.Mustapha, however, solicited employment opportunities, empowerment and medical assistance for IDPs in the nation’s capital. “Many of us are ready and willing to embrace farming but we don’t have access to farmland that we can cultivate.
