ABUJA – Supporters of Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi have launched #DignityInLabour campaign following a critical comment by the Presidential Candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. During the mega rally of the ruling party in Osun on Tuesday, Tinubu had described Labour Party and others as mushroom parties, saying “they would labour till they die. “Think about your children and vote accordingly, so you can see the future. Come out en masse. Don’t mind PDP and other mushroom parties – parties like Labour; they will labour till they die. God will not make you labourers,” Tinubu had said. The comment has sparked outrage, especially on Twitter. As a means to respond to Tinubu, Obi’s supporters started tweeting pictures of them in their various line of duty. Below are some of such tweets. @FS_Yusuf_ said, “#OBIDIENTS make we enter market o. Abeg na wetin u dey sell o. Open your shop make we see the dignity in your Labour o. You no dey thief.
