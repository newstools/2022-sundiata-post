Both Oyetola and Adeleke contested for the Osun governorship position in 2018, which Oyetola won after a rerun.The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has assured the people of a free and fair poll and spent most of yesterday moving sensitive voting materials to the 332 registration areas across the 30 local government areas of the state.The election umpire restated its readiness to announce the result in less than 12 hours after the poll.The two leading political parties are desperate to win today’s contest to signpost readiness to dominate the 2023 elections.To underpin the importance of the poll, the presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Tinubu led a final campaign for Oyetola last Tuesday. He was accompanied by party chieftains like the party’s National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, vice presidential candidate, Kashim Shettima and several APC governors.The PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar also led a powerful campaign team to the state on Thursday assuring the people that Adeleke is sure of victory in the poll, and that “an end has come to the reign of the ruling APC” in the country.Atiku was accompanied by the National Chairman of the PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu; Vice-presidential candidate of the party and Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa; former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki and some governors of the PDP.For most of yesterday, tension remained very high across Osun State, with voters bitterly divided among the two leading candidates.Fear of violence was palpable, considering the rancorous campaigns before the poll.The allegations by the PDP that the APC was working to rig the poll dominated discussion across the state.Police Deploy 21,000 OperativesThe Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba has assured Nigerians that today’s poll would be violence-free.Baba, who spoke last Tuesday, said to accomplish the task, no fewer than 21,000 operatives would be deployed across the state.Baba warned that the police would not allow any person or group of persons, no matter how highly and lowly placed in the society to derail the electoral process, and vowed that “vote-buying or any form of inducement would not be allowed as they remained serious offences.”The IG adds: “The police will be deployed to protect the facilities of INEC and its personnel. This deployment is not meant to intimidate any law-abiding citizens; rather it is to deter misguided elements that may threaten the conduct of the election and violate the electoral act. It also serves as a strong warning that government is determined to protect the citizens.”The IG has also deployed the Deputy Inspector-General of Police in charge of the Force Criminal Investigation Department, DIG Johnson Kokumo, for the governorship election.Also deployed to the state are four Assistant Inspectors-General of Police, four Commissioners of Police, 15 Deputy Commissioners of Police, and 30 Assistant Commissioners of Police.Baba also moved the Osun State Commissioner of Police, Olawale Olokode (temporarily) to the Force Headquarters until the conclusion of the election.
