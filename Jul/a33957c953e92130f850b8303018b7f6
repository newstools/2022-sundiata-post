By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) -. The All Progressives Congress has postponed the unveiling of Kashim Shettima as the running mate of its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu. However, no official reason had been given as of the time of filing this report. Also, no new date has been announced for the unveiling. Recall that Tinubu announced Shettima as his running mate on Sunday, saying the former Borno State Governor was picked to enable good governance. But the APC had failed to officially announce Shettima as Tinubu’s running mate four days after. Controversy, however, greeted Shettima’s choice as some northern governors expressed reservations. Also, many Nigerians faulted the selection of Shettima as Tinubu’s running mate, warning the APC against having a Muslim-Muslim ticket. By YAKUBU UBA Governor Babagana Zulum MAIDUGURI- Gov.
