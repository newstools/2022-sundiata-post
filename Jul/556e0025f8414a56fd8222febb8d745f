By FOLASADE AKPAN ABUJA- An NGO, The Albino Foundation (TAF), has commended Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the use of magnifying glasses for persons with albinism in the governorship election, held in Osun on Saturday.Founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the organisation, Mr Jake Epelle, gave the commendation in a statement issued on Monday in Abuja.He said that INEC followed due process and engaged TAF in the sampling process to ensure quality product that met global standard.”Information from the field shows that the magnifying glasses were effectively deployed, while many persons with albinism used them during the voting procedure.”We are glad that INEC took particular interest in the usage of the magnifying glass and tweeted its useby a gentleman with albinism.”This development has assured that the 2023 general elections will be conducted with the same level of interest,” he added.According to Epelle, the foundation encourages continuous training of both INEC and ad hoc staff members to ensure compliance in future elections.He appreciated the INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, and the commission’s staffers for their efforts at ensuring the inclusion of persons with albinism in the voting process.”Furthermore, we are aware that this is the most inclusive election, with priority voting for persons with disabilities and the provision of Braille ballot papers for the blind.”However, it was noticed that some polling units were placed on high ground, thus making them inaccessible,” Epelle said.He also commended the people of Osun for the peaceful conduct of the governorship election and congratulated the governor-elect, Sen. Ademola Adeleke, for winning the election.
