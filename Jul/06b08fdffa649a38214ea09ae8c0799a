All we can do is to pray God to give us grace to bear this loss. It is not only a loss to you as family, it is a loss to us as party.“Chief Kemi Nelson came, saw, added value and impacted humanity. Our party in Lagos state,  in the zone and Nigeria lost a woman of reputation, who was brilliant, intellectual, loyal, faithful, capable, sociable and committed to whatever cause she believed in.“She left when we needed her most but the legacy she left behind will continue to be a guide to us,” Kekemeke, the APC chairman in the South West, said.According to her, the zone considers it very important to come and sympathise with the family and to assure them of the  party’s readiness to be part of the funeral arrangements.Kekemeke added that late Nelson was a very committed party woman leader with a trademark.The APC boss added: “She was a role model to all women in the party and she fought to find a place for the women folk for politics of the party and in the nation.“She was in the business of mobilising women in the zone and Nigeria for our party.“With the kind of experience she had, this is the time to tap from her knowledge and experience in our crusade, struggle and campaign to win the next round of elections.“She will not physically be able to give that, but spiritually we will be guided by what she said, what she stood for and how she did it.”Also speaking, Mr Lateef Ibirogba, the APC  Zonal Organising Secretary , added that late Nelson led an examplary life, hence the need to celebrate her memories for a life well spent.“Mrs Nelson stood  for everything that is good. We are at this level because of her contributions to the party and to Nigeria. We will forever miss her for giving the women folk a voice.“She stood her ground and made sure our women get a voice . Today, the party has established that wherever you give two slots out, one must be a woman , that is because women like that fought for it.“We will continue to miss her because she did her best for us,”Ibirogba said.Responding for the family, Mr Adedamola Kasunmu, who represents Ikeja Constituency II in the Lagos state House of Assembly, said  the family had lost a great mother.Kasunmu said: “We, as children, know that Nigeria lost a great woman.
