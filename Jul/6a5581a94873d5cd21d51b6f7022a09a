So I feel recharged, this is like a challenge for us to do more.”There is a lot to be done, there is a lot that has been done but like I said, we have to intensify and double up efforts because those numbers have to shrink and we have to intervene for this people.”Another awardee, Dr Sanusi Ohiare, Executive Director, Rural Electrification Agency, said his agency would re-double its effort towards providing access and scaling up interventions to reach all rural Nigerians.”I am humbled because my career in public service is quite short, I have just spent about six years and I’m getting this award.”That goes to show that it is not how far but how well, so given the little opportunity that one has, you need to demonstrate capacity and make sure you excell in all you do.”For us at the Rural Electrification Agency, we have tried our best since we came on board since 2017, to bring about different projects and programmes that will affect the lives of rural communities across Nigeria ”And this award would allow us re-double our efforts towards providing access and scaling up our interventions to reach all rural Nigerians.”So I dedicate this award to those rural people that we are yet to reach and we are assuring them that in no distant time we would reach them, Ohiare said.Earlier, the Managing Director, BusinessDay Media Ltd.
