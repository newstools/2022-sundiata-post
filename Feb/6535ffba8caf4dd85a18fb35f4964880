Onyeka Onwenu, the legendary Nigerian music star, has narrated the pains she experienced in her marriage which crashed.  In an interview with media personality, Kikelomo Atanda-Owo, anchor of Real Talk with Kike, Onwenu said it was tough, but she had to take a stand for her children. The diva said she paid the fees of her children from kindergarten to master’s level. Taking a swipe at her ex-husband, she said any man who fails to fulfill his responsibility as a father will answer to God. “I really didn’t want my marriage to end, but I couldn’t take it anymore. It could have killed me, I always say and that’s the truth.” “And it was not good for the children to live in that kind of environment where the mother is depressed, the mother is carrying the weight of the whole family. I raised my children from kindergarten to Master’s Degree. “My husband did not pay school fees for one day. Didn’t buy clothes, didn’t pay for holidays, didn’t give me housekeeping money. Hard to believe huh? But he was a kind, nice and generous man. He was also generous occasionally, he would do something for you that would make you go, ‘Wow!’ “But basically, there was control. If you didn’t do things the way he wanted, ‘well, I’m not going to help you, I’m not going to give you money.’ “And I would like to say this to Nigerians, any man who has children, has a family and decides not to take care of them, you will have to answer to God. That’s mean, irresponsible, wicked, even to your own children. Forget about the wife. I decided to write about it because women, we keep quiet for too long, we take so much and you’re dying.”  Source Veteran entertainer, Onyeka Onwenu, who recently turned 70 years old, has opened up about her crashed marriage.
