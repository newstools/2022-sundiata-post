COS NA COLA-NUT U BE ! Don’t think too highly of yourself, you no hard like that, everyone knows, and you know too.” She also revealed that the actress was a one-time ‘Cola nut’ to her elder brother. “Not so long a go you were my elder brother’s COLA-NUT, so I was shocked to see on a blog that you’ve changed base. Little girl, apparently, your SOUL needs surgery as well,” she alleged. “P.S, I don’t know what story he told you, but, if I was still with Timaya, you can never be “friends” with him!
