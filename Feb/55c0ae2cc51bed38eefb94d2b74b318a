The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) says that it has strengthened collaboration with Service Compact (SERVICOM) to create a better road safety culture in the country.  The Corps Marshal, FRSC, Boboye Oyeyemi, said this during the inauguration of a sensitsation programme to propagate the FRSC National Traffic Radio (NTR) on Friday in Abuja.Oyeyemi said SERVICOM focused on service delivery, adding that it had accessed the level of propagation of advocacy, education and enlightenment by FRSC.According to him, the purpose of SERVICOM is to ensure the service delivery of FRSC as regards enhancing road safety culture and management get to the grassroots.“That one, the public is fully aware of the National Traffic, 107.1FM, promoting road safety culture in the public to make people comply with traffic rules and regulations.“It is a continuous exercise that will be extended to other parts of Abuja. SERVICOM believes we should be able to communicate better with the public through the NTR.“And this will be promoted to raise the level of awareness, hence the commencement of this enduring partnership,” he said.Oyeyemi said the Corps would be covering every part of Abuja, adding that it would extend its service to other areas such as Gwagwalada, Abaji, Suleja, Masaka Karu, Nyanya and Zuba.He said Abuja should be a model when it comes to road safety management administration.When people are driving, they should imbibe the ideals of road safety and drive properly.“Use your seat belt, don’t take one way and drive effectively. And it is only SERVICOM that can help in this regard because of their level of service delivery.“We want to appeal to Nigerians to also tune into the NTR, 107. 1 FM to listen to traffic rules and regulations,” he said.The Executive Director, SERVICOM, Mrs Nnenna Akajemeli, said the strong message was to promote and continue the enlightenment of all stakeholders.Akajemeli said service delivery was about being sensitive to the needs and expectations of these service takers, the road users.This she said was the need to work in strong synergy and collaboration with FRSC management and also in strong partnership with the media.She said SERVICOM had enhanced awareness raising to all groups and all citizens of Nigeria, and that the essence was to reduce to the barest minimum the number of crashes and errors.She added that the bottom line was to save lives and touch Nigerians to proactively prepare them and get Nigerians better organised while using the road and avoid those things that lead to crashes.“As you know today is about raising the bar on the information as passed through the NTR.“We are promoting and reaching the people, so we are taking this message out to the public so that as people drive, we have increase listenership and followership.“We are working on excellent motoring culture in Nigeria.“And to this, we need to let out a lot of information, we need to educate stakeholders, and enlighten Nigerians and all the stakeholders including children who go to school on the best use of the road,” she said.
