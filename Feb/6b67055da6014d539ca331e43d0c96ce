Wike said however that the PDP cannot take over the State if they are not united. “Therefore every one should keep his aspiration and focus on uniting the party so as to salvage Plateau State and the country. “The most important thing to do for now is to ensure that the PDP is united and that is why I have come to see to it that I unite the faction of Lt.
