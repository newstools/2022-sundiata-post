A 28-year-old former stripper from New York left is running for Congress in Philadelphia’s troubled 3rd District.  Alexandra Hunt stripped during college “to pay the bills,” she wrote recently in Daily Kos.And not only is she unapologetic about her former career, she has made it part of her campaign message. Her campaign website offers T-shirts reading “I MAY HAVE DANCED FOR MONEY BUT I’M NO CORPORATE WHORE” and “Elect Hoes.”Alexandria She used to fear the “age-old stigma” attached to s3x work, and said she was fired as a girls’ soccer coach when the team found out.
