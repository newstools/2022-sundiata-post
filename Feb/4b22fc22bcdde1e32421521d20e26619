  Popular OAP Toke Makinwa has questioned why people record themselves while crying. In a clip shared on her Instagram page, such an act is manipulative and absolutely senseless. “I am sick and tired of people who record themselves crying online. Do you have a mental illness? Are they sick in your family? Is there something wrong with you? Because I don’t get it. Who stole your cookies? It doesn’t make any sense”, Makinwa said “So, it’s almost manipulative. Do not think the people you’re coming online to cry to actually give a fvck. They don’t! you’re only giving them ammunitions.” In her caption, the 37-year-old lifestyle entrepreneur appealed to the person guilty of the act to desist from it. She wrote: “Pls let’s leave this behaviour in the past. Why will you on your camera, go live, press record and start crying. “Not trying to be mean but it is a cry for attention. Do you not have real friends? If you are crying why do you record it?”      Earlier today, Toke Makinwa exposed a fraudster who tried to blackmail her with her ‘nudes’, though Nigerians on social media believe it was all staged.
