Disgraced deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Abba Kyari has alleged that he was framed by a corrupt officer while stating that he is innocent of the drug-traffic allegations levelled against him by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA.On February 14, the NDLEA declared Kyari wanted “over his involvement in a 25kg cocaine deal”.  Hours later, the police announced his arrest and subsequent transfer to the NDLEA custody.The NDLEA’s revelation comes months after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) indicted Kyari for conspiring with Hushpuppi, a self-confessed international fraudster, in a $1.1 million scam targeting Qatari business people.In the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/182/22, Kyari accused the NDLEA of assisting drug traffickers, alleging that a corrupt NDLEA officer framed him after he went to demand compensation for a whistleblower who provided information that led to the arrest of a suspect by the police intelligence response team (IRT).He alleged that the suspect has been bringing cocaine into Nigeria from Ethiopia via all of the country’s airports “with the knowledge of the NDLEA officers”.Kyari, in an affidavit deposed to by one Muhammad Nur Usman, who claimed to be his younger brother, told the court that NDLEA officers usually cleared the suspect “and even escorted him from the airport to his destination”.“That on that fateful day, the suspect as usual shipped drugs (cocaine) from Ethiopia to Enugu airport. The officer of NDLEA cleared him within the airport, then officers of FIB-IRT arrested the suspect with the help of information,” the affidavit reads.“That before the informant accepted to work with the officers of FIB-IRT, they both had an agreement to compensate the informant.“That officers of FIB-IRT having noticed that officers of NDLEA were the ones clearing the said suspect with his drugs (cocaine), they immediately took the suspect to NDLEA and also reported those officers involved in the act.“That instead of the NDLEA to handle the matter accordingly and bring their officers involved to book, they decided to frustrate the informant, thereby refusing to compensate the informant.“That it was at this juncture that the attention of the DCP Abba Kyari was called, whom because the NDLEA officer involved is his friend, decided to intervene for the purpose of compensating the informant.“That the NDLEA officer who refused to compensate the informant was the one who framed DCP Abba Kyari up on a trump-up allegation that he was trying to bribe him.“That the agent of the respondent (NDLEA) declared the applicant wanted because of a mere allegation that he was trying to bribe an NDLEA officer without sufficient proof.“That the Nigerian police force, based on the allegation of the respondent, arrested the applicant on the 12th day of February, 2022, and handed over to the NDLEA.”Kyari insisted that there was no proof to support the allegation upon which he was arrested and detained.“That the applicant is a decent police officer who has distinguished himself in areas of serving his father’s land as a police officer,” the document reads.“That the applicant needs to be compensated and not to be dragged about, receiving torture, degrading and inhuman treatment by anybody or agency whatsoever.“That there is no sufficient proof that the applicant has committed any offence to warrant this torture, degrading and inhuman treatment.”  source Daily Post reports that Ohanaeze Ndigbo worldwide has urged the Federal Government of Nigeria to allow the suspended head of IRT, DCP Abba Kyari, to be extradited to the United States to face the allegations from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) over the hushpuppi scandal.
