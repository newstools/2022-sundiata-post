THANK YOU JESUS AGAIN FOR ANOTHER LIFE FOR THIS DAUGHTER OF ZION! The Devil fought you! But God fought for you! The Lord gave you Resounding Victory Again and Again! “I thank God Again and Again that I found you! Only God Can Give a Man a Good Wife. If I have not Found Jesus Christ, I would have missed YOU!. Because WHEN I knew I had a Call of God on My Life, I knew I would never succeed in life unless I got it Right in the Place of Marriage. “I knew I could Marry just any Sister and just have some Children, but not the Ordained Sister from Heaven who would give me the Children She Could sit down to train. I knew I did my part in training our children, but the greater duties were taken by GLORIA. She was never tired of sitting them down to teach them the Word of God. “She was never tired of giving them Cautions. She was never tired of even controlling how they eat and what they eat. She was very strict with THOSE BOYS and that GIRL when they were living under our roof before they graduated from our House! GLORIA IS AN IDEAL WIFE. If I had not accepted Jesus Christ, I would have missed HER. Because I would never have heard the Voice that spoke to me that morning to leave where I was and travel to where I met her for the first time. I thank God.” What did she see in me when she said YES to my Proposal? She saw VISIONS! She saw CALLING! SHE SAW WHAT I DID NOT SEE! THE GIRL WHO SAW TOMORROW! I had been on full time and she had been in School.I would collect money from her and use it to print program Posters.Then when she began to work during f the one year Service,She would collect her allowance and bring it to me to use for programs. CELEBRATE THE GIRL WHO SAW TOMORROW! Ah! She never saw any inadequacies in me but VISIONS and CALLING and MINISTRY. No job, but ministry. No house but Only One Room that contained all my belongings: standing hanger, cupboard, bookshelf, cooking pots and a standing Fan that had no leg and a small black and white Television. She saw into the future! She saw Greatness and Relevance in the future. She Married me at 24! And I was 28! TODAY, SHE IS 58 and still growing Stronger in Him! Still Looking Radiant and Beautiful! On Behalf of Dammy, Ella, Gloria and Little Grace; On behalf of Joshua, Tolu and little Jason, On behalf of Lawrence, Dara and Prophet Elijah, the bouncing boy!
