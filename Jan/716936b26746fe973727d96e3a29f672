Mohammed Musa’s integrity, track records, firmness and simplicity among those in the APC national Chairmanship race.“For us in the South-South Emerging Leaders’ Forum, we believe that the best way the ruling party can continue to discourage corruption as clearly stated in the agenda of President Muhammadu Buhari is to elect a new national chairman that’s free of EFCC or ICPC cases.“We also note that since the successful merger process that produced the APC, former governors have had enough time.“From our father former governor of Osun State Chief Bisi Akande, who was succeeded by another former governor of Edo State Chief John Odigie Oyegun and later to another former governor of Edo, Adams Oshiomhole.“We feel it is time to try a Senator and a competent hand at that, we therefore appeal to APC leaders at all levels to support the aspiration of Sen.
