Ghana has been booted out of the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations.  The four-time champions were beaten by debutants Comoros in a thrilling 3-2 encounter. Ghana suffered the humiliating group-stage exit yesterday. El Fardou Ben Nabouhane put the islanders ahead early on, and Ghana then went down to 10 men when Andre Ayew was shown a straight red card. Ahmed Mogni doubled the lead before the Black Stars fought back to make it 2-2. However, Mogni tapped in his second in the 85th minute to inflict Ghana’s first group-stage exit since 2006. The result in Group C will go down as one of the biggest shocks in Nations Cup history as Comoros scored at the finals for the first time and then went on to record their maiden victory.
