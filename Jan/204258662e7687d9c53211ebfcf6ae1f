American singer and songwriter, Jason Derulo, attacked two men in Las Vegas for trolling him and calling him the name of another R&B popstar, Usher Raymond.  Derulo was on an escalator in a Las Vegas hotel when a guy trolled him, eyewitnesses told TMZ. The report revealed that the man yelled at the singer saying, “Hey, Usher! F*** you, bitch!”. At that instant, Derulo charged at the man, punching him right in the face. It was also alleged that Jason slapped the second man a few moments later, which led to an intervention of security operatives. According to the video shared by TMZ, Derulo had charged at the guys despite being escorted by a large man, assumed to be his bodyguard. Though the two victims didn’t press charges on Derulo, the singer got a trespassing notice from the hotel where the fight broke out. Consequently, he was removed from the property. Page Six reported that the singer was handcuffed and carted away by security personnel after the incident.
