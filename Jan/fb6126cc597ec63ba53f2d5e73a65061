All these projects are contractor funded, with structures that provide very beneficial payment terms that give the state upfront value (front-loaded) ahead of payments; thereby increasing the sustainability benefits to the state.” On human capital development and social interventions, Egube said, “the human capital continues to be an area of deep interest to the state.

All this will strengthen our aspiration to be the technology hub for Africa.” On youth development, he said given the demography of Lagos, investment in technology, the 8 stadia, Agriculture, Entertainment and Tourism are largely targeted at our youth development and engagement. We believe that Lagos has one of the most innovative youth populations in Africa, which we intend to continue to cultivate. Egube noted that there was a difference between the total budget size presented by the Executive and the final size passed by the Legislature adding that the difference was largely accounted for by the decision during the bilateral meeting with the MDAs to further accelerate already existing projects to bring them to substantial closure. He listed some of the projects under the contractor financed programs to include: 24km Red line rail from Agbado to Oyingbo (phase 1) to includes 10 bridges/overpasses, 13 pedestrian bridges and 8 train stations while the 13kilomtre Blue line rail from Mile 2 to Marina with sea crossing (phase 1), the 20 km Lagos Badagry Expressway to Okokomaiko, both project estimated to gulp N153 billion for the completion of the first phase. Others include Expanded Drainage construction/rehabilitation/maintenance program, channelization of waterways among other infrastructure projects.
