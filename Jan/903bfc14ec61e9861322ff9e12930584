KANO – A socio-cultural group, the Northern Youth Unity Forum, has revealed that over 5,000 northerners are currently held as prisoners in different prisons in Lagos State. According to the chairman of the forum, Dr. Ibrahim Yau Galadanchi, who was represented by Ibrahim Usman, most of the northerners leave their states in search of greener pastures and are apprehended by security agencies. “Whenever our men trooped from different northern states and arrive Lagos, security agencies and the area boys interrogated them about the purpose of their visit to the state, and from there they locked them in prisons,” he said while addressing reporters in Kano. The group urged all the Northern Governors to investigate this issue and engage the Lagos State Government in order to release the northerners unjustly imprisoned.
