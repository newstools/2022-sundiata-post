Chris Brown has reacted after he was sued for $20 million for alleged rape. According to TMZ, the 32-year-old artist is accused of raping a woman in late 2020 outside Diddy’s Star Island home. The plaintiff, identified as Jane Doe, claims she was speaking to a friend via FaceTime when Brown grabbed the friend’s phone and told her to come to Miami immediately. The lawsuit states the woman who describes herself as a model, choreographer, and musical artist arrived on the property on Dec. 20 and met Brown on a yacht parked at Diddy’s residence. Shortly after she boarded the yacht, Brown allegedly asked her if she wanted a drink. The complaint states she accepted the offer and followed the singer into the yacht’s kitchen area, where she was handed a mixed drink. Jane Doe says she and Brown began talking before she was given a refill; it was at that time, the woman claims to have experienced “a sudden, unexplained change in consciousness.” The lawsuit alleges the woman became “disoriented, physically unstable, and started to fall in and out of sleep.” Brown then allegedly took her to a bedroom while she was “drugged” and wouldn’t let her leave.  Jane Doe says Brown then removed her bathing suit bottom and began kissing her. She claims the artist ignored her pleas to stop and proceeded to rape her. The woman is seeking $20 million damages over the emotional stress caused by the alleged attack. According to the complaint, Brown then ejaculated inside the woman, stood up, and told her that he was “done.” Reacting on Instagram, the American R&B singer describe the claim as ” bulls**t” and went on to suggest that there is always an agenda brought up against him whenever he’s planning to drop new music or a project.              •Chris Brown American singer Chris Brown has been sued for allegedly raping a woman in a yacht.
