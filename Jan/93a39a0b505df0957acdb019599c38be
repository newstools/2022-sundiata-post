The Nigerian senate is seeking a bill to make it illegal for landlords to demand payment of advance rent from tenants of residential and office buildings and spaces beyond three months.  Sponsor of the bill Senator Smart Adeyemi who spoke to newsmen about the bill, said it would enable tenants to make a maximum advance payment of three months’ rent, with subsequent monthly payments. Pointing out that landlords have been compelling tenants to make one-year and two-year advance rent payments before renting their apartments, which sometimes is not affordable for many Nigerians, Adeyemi revealed that the proposed legislation stipulates a maximum advance rent payment of three months and after the expiration of the three-month rent, the tenants are expected to pay monthly.
