Nollywood actress, Caroline (Hutchings) Danjuma, has opened up on her separation for the first time since her split from her ex-husband, Musa Danjuma.  The actress on her Instagram page said she had blamed herself for not making a perfect marriage and she only realised she was not a failure when she started to heal. According to her, she dealt with the hurtful words and constant mockery from friends and strangers who did not know what truly happened to her marriage. She wrote, “I blamed myself for not making a perfect marriage, I blamed myself for both faults of ours until I started healing then I knew I was not a failure. “I prayed to God for assistance most importantly to forgive myself and him. Rather than hate the outcome of what was, I chose love and peace of mind for what is. We both ain’t perfect and that is what makes us human. “I dealt with the hurtful words from friends and strangers, the stigma and constant mockery without knowledge of what truly happened. “God whispered, I am with you and that was it. My journey to finding me began and I never looked back. I came, I saw, I conquered ☺️, most importantly I have found my lost identity. Healed, restored, unprovoked, loving and blessed ..#howcarolynagothergrooveback💋.
