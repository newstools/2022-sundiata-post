Overhyped social media Governor. 😅 — Adams Oshiomhole (@A_Oshiomhole) January 20, 2022Adeyanju had tweeted, “The way those paid to defend Seyi on SM were hyping him, I thought when I get to Oyo; I will see wonders. All lies, zero substance on ground. Was in Ibadan last year to deliver a lecture at NBA conference, nothing tangible on ground.
