A Federal High Court in Lagos has set comedian, Joshua Sunday a.k.a. De General free over the drug trafficking charges against him.  The social media influencer was arraigned by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) alongside Caleb William, a cinematographer on Monday, January 24, 2022 before Justice Daniel Osiagor. During the hearing, the Judge noted that the volume of substance was minimal for which he would not convict but caution the defendants. The prosecutor had told the court that the offences committed by the convicts are contrary to and punishable under section 11 (c) of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency ACT CAP N30 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004. The prosecutor further urged the court to sentence the two men as prescribed by section 356(2) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) 2015, having pleaded guilty to the charge. But Justice Osiagor declined to sentence the convicts. He cautioned them ‘to go and sin no more’.
