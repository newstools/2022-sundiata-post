By DIANA OMUEZA ABUJA- Dr Jumoke Oduwole, Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Ease of Doing Business, has urged youths to join political parties, actively participate and vote wisely in the 2023 General Elections.Oduwole said this during the 2022 programme on “This Generation Conference” on Sunday in Abuja.The conference is an annual project of Buildman Leadership Foundation, an arm of The Summit Bible Church in Abuja.Oduwole said that the 2023 general elections were the perfect year for youths to redefine the type of government and governance they desired.According to her, the youth must vote wisely or they will continue to “Japa” (Run away) to strange lands in search of what they could easily get here in Nigeria.“2023, the power to redefine Nigeria is in the hands of our youths. Just as the theme of the year’s conference is to ‘Take a Stand’, I urge the youth to truly take a stand in politics come 2023.“Just as we have heard all the brilliant speakers, politics is a dirty game they all say, but the power to change politics to a decent game lays in our hands.“If we continue to run away, we would all continue to complain, but just as I have taken a stand in politics as a young girl, I urge us all to join politics, get active, and participate.“I want a better Nigeria for myself, my children and their unborn generations and even for my parents now,” she said.Mrs Abiodun Essiet, Special Adviser on ICT/Civil Societies and Donor Agencies to AMAC Chairman, also urged the youth to join politics by joining progressive political parties and making relevant contribution to government policies.Mr Seyi Adisa, Oyo State House of Assembly member, also urged youths to refrain from social media politics and take active part in physical politics but cautioned against involvement in dirty dealings.Dr Andy Osakwe, the Convener of the foundation, during his welcome address, said that 2023 was an opportunity as an election year for Nigerians to decide the national destiny for the country.Osakwe advised the youth not to involve in partisan politics.“2022 is a year of politicking for Nigerians.“This year political parties with their chosen flag-bearers for various elective positions will move through the length and breadth of the nation to sell their visions and plans to voters.“It is against this backdrop that This Generation 2022 will among other things, border on the qualities that make for building great nations.“Our conversation will thrive on righteous and patriotic service life, the importance of infiltrating governance and public offices with morally competent citizens who can chart the course to leap the nation and proffer qualities of the ideal leaders,” he said.Major Highlight of the event was the award of cash prizes to three outstanding participants of “This Generation Community ChangeMakers Challenge”.Through the challenge, youths in the FCT were encouraged to implement impactful community projects.Mr Solomon Akaan came first and won  N200,000 for his novelty football competition and rally to raise awareness on drug abuse project.Mr Shane Okoroh and Ms Christiana Robert came second and third position and both won N100,000 and N50,000 cash prizes.Okoroh initiated the “Providing food to Uber and Bolt drivers project” while Robert initiated the “Cleanup of Kabusa market entrance project”.
