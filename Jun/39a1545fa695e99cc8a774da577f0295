The man who should have been president lost his life while suffering in an unlawful detention. Other democratic patriots suffered the same fate.“Lives and livelihoods were endangered and shattered. But the love of the human spirit for freedom and justice is unstoppable.“No amount of weaponry, no measure of suppressive force and no amount of propaganda can no longer restrain the cry for liberty and the rightful demand for a voice in how society is governed.“That election, though almost 30 years ago, provides vital and reassuring lessons to Nigeria today,” he said.The APC presidential candidate said first, it showed that Nigerians were capable of democratic excellence and conducting elections as good as anywhere else on earth.Tinubu noted that secondly, Abiola won a truly national mandate, his victory and mandate, though unfairly and unlawfully stolen, showed Nigeria’s unity was not an impractical dream.According to him, “although we are diverse in terms of ethnicity and religion, we all seek good governance, a better life and the positive things that result from sustained good governance.The former governor said this year’s democracy Day holds greater significance because they just concluded fair, transparent, and open primaries in his party.Tinubu congratulated all the other candidates for their nominations and their parties for doing their part to sustain democratic processes as the mainstay of their political life.He said APC was able to conduct a successful primary election due to the good leadership of President Buhari, and key party stakeholders like the governors, party leadership and the delegates.Tinubu said God bless Nigeria, praying that the souls of the martyrs of June 12 and the democratic struggle continue to rest in peace.
