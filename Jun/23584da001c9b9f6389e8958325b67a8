By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Federal lawmaker representing Benue South in the red chamber of the 9th National Assembly, Senator Abba Moro has said that the major problem facing Nigeria is that more than half of the national resources end more in private pockets than the open pool for the execution of public good. He stated this on Tuesday while fielding questions from newsmen on wide range of issue after leading the debate on the Bill for an Act to establish the Federal College of Agricultural Technology, Opialu-Ojapo (2022). Abba Moro who was reacting to the lingering face off between the Academic Staff Union of Universities and the Federal Government, said the lingering crisis is as a result of lack of respect for agreements. According to him, “year in year out, ASUU and FG will reach agreement on fundamental issues, yet these agreements have been executed more in the breach on implementation. Reacting to the usual excuse of paucity of fund on the part of government, the former Interior Minister said if you are saying you don’t have enough money to develop your education, look at what is happening among the political parties where individual aspirants to offices have been seen to donate 200 SUVs to delegates and similar things of monumental proportion. That results from the fact that our electoral process is poorly regulated. This tells a story of a society that is more recognized in profligacy than prudence and I tell you that more than half percent of National resources end more i.n private pockets than the open pool in the execution of public good. The Senator stressed that unless we stand up to these problems, we will not have a space and the resources with which to do what we are supposed to do. Adding that it’s not that people don’t know what to do or the right thing to do, but just that individual will be poorer if they do the right thing. Abba Moro asked: How do you explain the fact that students, our children are out of School for. Months and years and nobody cares to raise as much as a whimper”. Sundiata Post recalls that earlier during the plenary at the floor of the Senate, Senator Abba Moro in his lead debate said the Federal College of Agricultural Technology, Opialu-Ojapo, when established will train and produce morally sound graduates to become self-employed in the area of Science and Agriculture; establish linkages and collaboration with other policy makers, research institutes and training institutions; establish and manage modern standard livestock farms, veterinary clinics and diagnostic laboratories, produce technicians capable of carrying out routine preventive measures and advisory services in livestock, fishery and crop production, promote capacity building through outreach programs, vocational training, continuous education among others in the area of Science and agriculture, promote youth development and empowerment opportunities through entrepreneurial and agricultural activities. “It is pertinent to mention that agriculture with its allied sectors is undeniably the biggest livelihood provider in Nigeria, especially in the rural areas, and contributes significantly to the country’s Gross Domestic Product(GDP). Adding that demand for agricultural products is daily on the increase with increase in population and per capital income and growing demand from industrial sectors. He said in the face of the current security challenge that threatens food security, a knowledge-driven agricultural practice is an imperative need. Abba Moro urged all senators to support this very essential Bill and pass it accordingly. Recall that the Bill was read for the first time on Wednesday, 26th January, 2022.
