By TOBA AJAYI ILORIN- An Ilorin based legal practitioner, Mr Bayo Ahmed, has advocated the need for more women to take part in political activities in the country. Ahmed, who gave the advice in Ilorin on Friday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), said women should stop running away from politics. According to him, most women see politics as strictly men activities. “Politics is not men’s game alone. It’s everybody’s game. Women are as important as men in politics. “Most parents discourage their grown up daughters to play politics. They tag it dirty and not good for women. “We have seen women in Nigeria performing well in their political offices. Women also have idea and can proffer solution to Nigeria problem, if allowed,” he said. Besides, the legal practitioner called on women to enter political stage and stop running away from politics. He called on government and political party officials to stop discriminating against women.
