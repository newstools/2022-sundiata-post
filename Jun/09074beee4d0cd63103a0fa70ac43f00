Before now, 1994 set was regarded as the game changer.“But from what we are seeing today, the 1982/84, 1987 and 1997 have raised the bar, and I know that next year’s celebrating sets will aspire to surpass them, so we expect greater things, ” he added.On the sidelines, Mr Skin Popoola, President OGS America, explained that the idea behind the computarisation was to promote e-Library, while the solarisation was to create an enabling environment for them to study at all times.According to him, it’s a serious information technology that you never had, worth 2 million dollars and a portion of the fund would be saved for maintenance and replacement.“For the computarisation, it will expose and prepare the students on ICT ahead of higher college, we don’t want them to be bound in this area; it will cut across repairs and training facility for programmes.“We will be working with university lecturers or professors that will be putting the students through, getting them ready for higher school,” he added.Meanwhile, Mr John Emore, Chairman OGS Uk/Europe, expressed displeasure at the prolonged ASUU strike which had kept students home and out of academic activities for months.Emore therefore, appealed to the government to seriously and urgently resolve the issue, adding that it was fundamental that priority should be given to education where the future relied.“We in Diaspora are not happy with the way education is being run here, we are appealing to the government to give its best to students so that they can do better than us.“If they are being given a lousy education, the country is going to get lousy administration and if Nigeria fails, blacks has failed because Nigeria is the most populated black nation in Africa.(NAN) By SEGUN FATUASE LAGOS - Nigeria’s oldest secondary school, CMS Grammar School, Bariga Lagos, established on June 6, 1859, on Tuesday began a weeklong anniversary celebration as the old boys under the platform of the Old Grammarians’ Society (OGS) reeled out the programme of events and numerous projects slated for… In "Education" CMS Grammar School: OGS To Inaugurate N27m Projects To Mark 158th Founder’s Day In "Education" By JOAN ODAFE Lagos- National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools (NAPPS) has urged its members to have succession plan, avoid unhealthy competition and be united in order to prevent any form of distress.The association made the call at an event to celebrate the third anniversary of its Amuwo Odofin… In "Health"
