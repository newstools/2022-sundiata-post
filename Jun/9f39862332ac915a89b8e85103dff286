We urge the government as a matter of urgency, to act decisively to arrest and make perpetrators of all these evil acts to face the full wrath of the law.”What Nigerians need at this time is peace, love, unity, hope and access to the basic necessities of life and not death, sorrow, pain and hopelessness,” he said.Baba-Panya prayed God to grant peace to the departed souls, console their families, the Catholic Church and the government and people of Ondo State.
