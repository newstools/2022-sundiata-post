By OLADAPO UDOM LAGOS- Wife of Lagos Governor, Mrs Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, has called on eligible voters, who have yet to get their permanent voter cards (PVCs) to do so without delay.Sanwo-Olu made the call at the Africa Bridge Initiative programme, held at Akerele Health Centre, Surulere.The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the governor’s wife was represented by Wife of the Special Adviser to the Governor on Drainage and Water Resources, Mrs Grace Igbokwe.NAN also reports that the programme had, as its theme: “Building the Nation Beyond the Polls.”Sanwo-Olu urged people must take advantage of the opportunity to register for their PVCs and be ready to participate in the electioneering process to choose leaders at various levels.“We all deserve to have a say in deciding on our leaders and this is the power that your PVC will give to you.“The level of development attained by any given society is a direct reflection of the quality of leadership in such society.“If the leaders in a particular society are not resolutely committed to implementing and sustaining revolutionary ideas in the best interest of the people, such a society will undoubtedly relish in backwardness,” she said.Sanwo-Olu, therefore, appealed to the people, especially the younger generation, to critically examine those who had put themselves forward for leadership positions and go for the best among them.“This is the right step to take and the right direction to go in rescuing our nation and bringing about the development that we crave,” she said.The governor’s wife commended the various projects and programmes of the Africa Bridge Initiative aimed at promoting peaceful co-existence for community development.“This has ensured harmonious relationships among the various faiths and community mobilisation toward ensuring peaceful elections in Nigeria.“We have enjoyed religious harmony and peaceful co-existence because of the commitment of all and sundry, and the efforts by government to respect the beliefs and rights of others.“Therefore, the intervention of Africa Bridge Initiative in helping to engender a peaceful society is truly commendable and worth sustaining,” Sanwo-Olu said.
