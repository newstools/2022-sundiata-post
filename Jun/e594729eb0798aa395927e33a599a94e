Find time and go for your PVC now instead of making noise.“Give priority to PVC and don’t wait for you to be pushed before taking it serious. You can not exercise your voting rights without your PVC.“Go to the nearest centres to get your PVC and stop blaming government every time. It is your responsibility to go and get your PVC and don’t expect anyone to bring it home to your door step,” he said.The lawyer further called on the public to act fast and collect their PVCs instead of blaming government actions every time.
