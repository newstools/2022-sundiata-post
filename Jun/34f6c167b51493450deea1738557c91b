A  clergyman, Pastor Adewale Giwa, has said that thugs across Nigeria would be emboldened should Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, presidential candidate of the ruling All Peoples Congress (APC) emerge president in 2023. Pastor Giwa of The Awaiting the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, Akure, Ondo State said the 36 states of the federation will be ruled by thugs following their notoriety in Lagos. The pastor, who was reacting to the victory of Tinubu, also said no one can pull the country out of its doldrums with the debt already incurred by President Muhammadu Buhari. While stressing that Tinubu is the only one capable of giving Atiku Abubakar, the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, a run for his money, the pastor emphasised that northerners will give Atiku their support ahead of 2023. However, Giwa, maintained that the only solution to the quagmire confronting the country is for the regions to part ways.
