By EKEOMA OGWO and AUGUSTA UCHEDIUNOR LAGOS- The Crime Victims Foundation of Nigeria (CRIVIFON) has appealed for the cooperation of security agencies, including the Criminal Justice Agency, The Nigeria Police Force and Civil Society agencies in  efforts to assist crime victims.According to it, this is to create a lasting legacy on national development and care for victims of crimes.CRIVIFON’s Founder and CEO, Mrs Gloria Egbuji, made the appeal in her keynote address at a human rights summit organised by CRIVIFON at the Anglican Church Conference Hall, Bariga, Lagos.The summit, which was in collaboration with The Human Rights Education and Awareness Center (HUREAC), had as its theme: “Strengthening Human Rights Advocacy”.Egbuji  was represented by Mr Frank Oshanugor, Editor-in-Chief / CEO, Atlantic News Online .She said: “The initiative stemmed from the fact that recorded high incidence of rights abuse by the police against the citizenry.“This was as a result of ignorance on what the Nigerian constitution and international documents like the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and African Charter on Human Rights decreed about the rights of persons”.Egbuji, who is a legal practitioner, observed that there had been a tremendous decline in the rate of police abuse of rights of persons since the establishment of the Human Rights Desk.“Records available reveal that since the introduction of the human rights desk at the various divisions in Lagos State Police Command.“ The average policeman is better refined in terms of his relationship with members of the public.“Even though there are still some bad elements within the force who brazenly abuse the rights of others, I dare say that more officers of the Police Force are improving seriously on how not to abuse the rights of others,’’ she said.Egbuji noted that CRIVIFON was the first NGO to introduce Gender Desk at police stations, and said that the initiative had helped immeasurably to improve policing activities.According to her, CRIVIFON, in line with its determination to improve policing, has till date, trained no fewer than  25,000 law enforcement officials, including police, army and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps ( NSCDC) on human rights and rule of law.“In collaboration with Human Rights Education and Awareness Centre, CRIVIFON, has trained 2,000 civilians on human rights and awareness; the training activities are still ongoing.’’Egbuji said that the idea of extending the human rights education and awareness to the civil populace is to bring more people in the society to understand what their rights are, and stand up for it as occasion may demand”.She added that the sensitisation also helped people to understand the rights of others.“This was the principal reason CRIVIFON chose to establish the Human Rights Education and Awareness Centre as a strategic unit dedicated entirely to human rights awareness.“It is, therefore, for this reason that we are appealing to security agencies and other related institutions to collaborate with the Crime Victims Foundation of Nigeria (CRIVIFON) in promoting a society free of human rights abuse,” she explained.Egbuji said that  CRIVIFON, which was established in 1996 and registered as an NGO with the sole aim of promoting the rights of victims of crime, had championed the presentation and debate at the National Assembly of the ‘Bill for Compulsory Treatment of Victims of Gunshot by Hospitals’ without police report.According to her, this is as many people have lost their lives through such rigorous process.“Though it took many arduous years to debate the bill and pass it into a law, it was eventually signed by President Buhari in 2018.“The presidential assent to the bill brought to fruition the battle CRIVIFON began in 1998. There are available records to show for the efforts over the years I’m this respect.’’However, she emphasised that although the bill had been signed into law by the president, it had yet  to be domesticated in the states for effective enforcement.“The Crime Victims Foundation of Nigeria (CRIVIFON) in collaboration with some interest groups are already at the vanguard of using Rivers State as a pilot state in the domestication plan,” she said.She stated that CRIVIFON was the first to conduct a victimsation survey in Nigeria and described the effort as a well-researched initiative which remained a valid source of information.She added that CRIVIFON was also working with schools on how best to prevent the emerging bullying culture in Nigerian schools with a view to minimizing child victim violence and sexual abuses.The National Coordinator of CRIVIFON, Dr  Kelechi Emeh, in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), appreciated the presence of the various law enforcement agencies and civil rights institutions.The agencies included the Nigeria Police Force, Lagos State Transportation Management Agency (LASTMA), Federal Road Safety Corp (FRSC), Office of Public Defender (OPD) and Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC).“The law enforcement agencies have, today, enlightened us to understand that we can always fight for our rights at any time, and that is what CRIVIFON is there for; to fight for the rights of the people.“A lot of people are falling victims of what they didn’t know about.“But we are here to tell people that society must always come out to fight for their rights.’’Emeh commended Egbuji for her determination and encouragement.He also thanked delegates from the states of Abia, Imo, Anambra and some from the Northern part of Nigeria.Emeh advised newly inducted members to discharge their duties responsibly and avoid bringing reproach to the foundation.
