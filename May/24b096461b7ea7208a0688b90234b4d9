By ALI BABA INUWA ABUJA- Claims by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of a ploy to extend President Muhammadu Buhari’s tenure is a diversionary tactic in the aftermath of the crisis that trailed its primaries at the weekend.According to the Buhari Media Organisation (BMO), it is irresponsible of the opposition party to concoct a plot out of the President’s delay in signing a further amendment to the Electoral Act 2022 at a time its primary election was marred by irregularities.In a statement signed by its Chairman Niyi Akinsiju and Secretary Cassidy Madueke, the group said it is shocking that barely 24 hours after PDP through its National Organising Secretary Umar Bature released guidelines for its primaries, “the party spokesman Debo Ologunagba threw caution to the wind with a spurious claim of a tenure elongation plot over the recently passed amendment to the Electoral Act that the President has yet to give his assent to.“For us, there is no explanation for this volte-face other than the harvest of crisis and drama that trailed the PDP primaries across the country.“From the kidnap of delegates in Osun and the death of a PDP member in Bayelsa to factional elections in Delta State, there are clear signs that PDP has not learnt from its past mistakes and this is what the party leadership wants to divert attention from, with its lame claim on the delayed Presidential assent.“Our advice is for the party that has been boasting about ‘rescuing Nigeria’ to first rescue itself from its time-tested violent ways and learn to play decent politics.“This advisory also extends to the need to act in a responsible manner instead of seeking to stoke crisis with unfounded claims,” it said.BMO wondered why any individual or group could hold the Presidency responsible for what the National Assembly has since described as an unintended error.(NAN) President Muhammadu Buhari I think the most frequently asked question today is, who will succeed President Muhammadu Buhari?
