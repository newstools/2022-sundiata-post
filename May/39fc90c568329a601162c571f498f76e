By JOAN ODAFE Lagos- National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools (NAPPS) has urged its members to have succession plan, avoid unhealthy competition and be united in order to prevent any form of distress.The association made the call at an event to celebrate the third anniversary of its Amuwo Odofin chapter, on Wednesday in Lagos.The Vice-Chairman of NAPPS in Amuwo Odofin, Mr Johnson Ologundudu, described school business as a very challenging one, adding that coming together as a body would help strengthen the quality of education being offered to children.Ologundudu, also the founder, Jomal Schools, said it was imperative for school owners to build brands, with legacies that would outlive them.“A big school around here is rounding off for sale because the owner died without any succession plan,” he said.He cautioned school owners against unhealthy competition that could prevent them from having a united front to tackle their challenges, including multiple taxes.The immediate Past Chairman of NAPPS in Lagos, Dr Wasiu Adumadeyin, urged school owners not to rest on their oars but strive toward achieving excellence.Adumadeyin, who is also the proprietor, Was-Lat Schools, urged them to be united so that they could achieve more.Also speaking, Founder of Stee Schools, Mrs Subola Lawal, cautioned school founders against running their schools with the mindset of profit making but of leaving lasting legacies in the lives of their students.Lawal, who received a Pacesetter Award, said running schools was not an easy feat, adding, however, that if done properly, there were lots of benefits there.“You need to pray; you need to have patience, perseverance, peace of mind and put more interest so you can enjoy running your schools.“You also need to pay your teachers well so that they too can enjoy their rewards here on earth, not in heaven,” she said.The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that while Life Patron award was given to Adumadeyin, Lawal, Lady Lauretta Nwosu of Loral International Schools and Mrs Ajoke Adeyemi of Foresight International School received Pacesetter Awards.
