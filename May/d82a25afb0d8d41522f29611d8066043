By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The attempt by a former governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha to force his release by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission today failed as Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High court, Abuja, refused his ex parte application asking to be released on bail pending the determination of a suit he filed against the Federal Government.
