This also needs to be tracked.“The goal is to ensure that the allocated funds were spent on what they were meant for, to reduce out-of-pocket expenditure and accelerateuniversal health coverage.”The new Act also enables the authority and state governments to develop information management systems and digital records forbetter data collection, monitoring and quality assurance.
