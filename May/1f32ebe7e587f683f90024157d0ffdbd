By ALEX ENEBELIENUGU- Sen. Ike Ekweremadu, gubernatorial aspirant in Enugu State says it will appeal the Federal High Court, Abuja ruling that dismissed his application seeking to upturn the PDP delegates list.This is contained in a statement they issued on Tuesday in Enugu, signed by Mr Charles Asogwa, Director-General, of the The Ikeoha Campaign Organisation.Recall that loyalists of Sen Ekweremadu, the former Deputy Senate President, had faulted the Wards Delegates by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state.He had approached the court to nullify the process leading to the election of the delegates organised by PDP in the state which his campaign organisation described as fake.According to the statement, the group received with shock the judgment of the Federal High Court, Abuja, that dismissed its application.It said the delegates from its own camp were truly emanated in compliance to the PDP Constitution and Guidelines for the Election of Three-Man Delegates and National Delegates in the April 30 Ward Congress of the PDP in Enugu State.“However, we appeal to our supporters to remain calm, as this is just the court of first instance.“Our lawyers have been directed to immediately file a Notice of Appeal against the judgment and we will surely pursue the matter to a logical conclusion.“We trust God and believe that victory will be ours eventually, for no matter how fast falsehood and injustice appear to travel, truth and justice will ultimately overtake both in the fullness of time,” It said. (NAN) •Gov Dave Umahi ENUGU - The Court of Appeal, Enugu Division on Friday affirmed the judgement of Ebonyi State High Court, Abakaliki, which quashed a suit challenging the defection of Governor Dave Umahi and his deputy, Dr Kelechi Igwe, to the All Progressives Congress (APC).
