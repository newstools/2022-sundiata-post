It is a self-limiting disease with symptoms of bump rashes in humans which is usually mild and lasts between 2-4 weeks with 3-6 per cent fatality rate.The disease is transmitted through close contact with infected person or animal and material contaminated with the virus.The main means of transmission is usually due to spillover from animals, man to man transmission is less common. The disease clinically resembles smallpox.Some identified risk factors include hunting, illegal trade in wildlife, handling of wildlife in wildlife markets.
