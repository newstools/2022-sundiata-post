By ABIODUN ESAN ILORIN- Members of a faction of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Kwara have boycotted primary elections conducted by the party to elect candidates for the 2023 general elections.A chieftain of the SDP in the state, Mr Adebara Adelowo, made this known in a statement in Ilorin.Adelowo, who said his faction of the SDP were the original members of the party in the state, described the primaries as illegal.“We were unable to participate in yesterday’s primary and that of Tuesday because we cannot build on the wrong foundation.“The primaries are unconstitutional. Whatever they are doing is illegal.“So, in view of this, we cannot go with them and we are law-abiding citizens, all that they were doing is illegal,” Adelowo said.He said members of the original and authentic SDP members would soon come out with a course of action.“I will not disclose our next line of action publicly for obvious reasons, but we are moving.“We are still in SDP, we are the original members of the party and nobody can chase us out of our party,” he said.The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the faction had criticised the taking over of the party by members of a faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) loyal to Alhaji Lai Mohammed, the Minister of Communication and Culture.They accused the party’s national leadership of imposing APC Loyal members on them in the state.They also reject the composition of the executive members of the party constituted about two months ago through what they called kangaroo congress.NAN also reports that SDP has held its House of Assembly primary elections and governorship election where Alhaji Hakeem Lawal, son of the former governor, late Mohammed Lawal, emerged as the governorship candidate.
