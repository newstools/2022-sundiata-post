I trust that you are not going to deviate this time around.“Our works have shown that we are not neophytes in politics.“We are not in government to struggle for relevance; we came to serve, we came to fix Osun.“We have taken note of other concerns, and we will attend to all in due time.“We must also remind you that this is an effort that requires collaboration. That is why we are appealing for your support, before, during and after the election, to enable us to fix the state,’’ he said.The governor also appealed to his supporters to realise that the state “is at a very delicate phase in history.“Let us entrust its leadership to hands that have been tested, not the hands of gamblers or jesters, or those who think Osun is for sale.’’Governorship election holds in Osun on July 16.Meanwhile, Commissioner for Information, Mrs Funke Egbemode, took two of the journalists that were injured by the hoodlums to the hospital for treatment.(NAN) By VICTOR ADEOTI •Professor Razaq Abubakre Osogbo- An emeritus professor, Razaq Abubakre, has predicted that the achievements of Osun governor, Gboyega Oyetola in his first tenure will make him win a second term in office. •Governor Gboyega Oyetola Oyetola is eligible and has been re-nominated by his party, the All… In "Politics" Ex-gov, Oyetola’s loyalists trade words over assassination claim• HURIWA seeks end to brewing political thuggery in Osun The leaderships of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) yesterday issued contradictory statements over attack on the former governor of Osun State and Minister of… In "News" By IFEANYI OLANNYE •Governor.
